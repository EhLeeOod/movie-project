### Recommendations/conclusions for what to do/not to do make a highly-rated movie.

To make a highly-rated movie, it is recommended to make something that suits people of all ages, perhaps comic-book or superhero based. It is also recommended to avoid sequels that lack depth and contain poor writing, or that don't come off as realistic to the audience.
